Q: Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part . Please .
A: Okay ... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine . Saturday ? Night ?
===
Q: The thing is , Cameron -- I 'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser . My sister . I ca n't date until she does .
A: Seems like she could get a date easy enough ...
===
Q: Gosh , if only we could find Kat a boyfriend ...
A: Let me see what I can do .
===
Q: How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing ?
A: Well , there 's someone I think might be --
===
Q: So that 's the kind of guy she likes ? Pretty ones ?
A: Who knows ? All I 've ever heard her say is that she 'd dip before dating a guy that smokes .
===
Q: Me . This endless ... blonde babble . I 'm like , boring myself .
A: Thank God ! If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure ...
===
Q: I have to be home in twenty minutes .
A: I do n't have to be home 'til two .
===
Q: Listen , I want to talk to you about the prom .
A: You know the deal . I ca n't go if Kat does n't go --
===
Q: I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you do n't get out of my way .
A: Can you at least start wearing a bra ?
===
Q: Oh my God , does this mean you 're becoming normal ?
A: It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we 're going .
===
Q: Like I 'm supposed to know what that even means .
A: It 's Shakespeare . Maybe you 've heard of him ?
===
Q: Bianca , I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
A: I really do n't think I need any social advice from you right now .
===
Q: I do care . But I 'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons , not someone else 's .
A: I wish I had that luxury . I 'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I ca n't go , because you wo n't .
===
Q: I guess I thought I was protecting you .
A: God , you 're just like him ! Just keep me locked away in the dark , so I ca n't experience anything for myself
Q: Not all experiences are good , Bianca . You ca n't always trust the people you want to .
A: I guess I 'll never know , will I ?
===
Q: Now do n't get upset . Daddy , but there 's this boy ... and I think he might ask ...
A: No ! You 're not dating until your sister starts dating . End of discussion .
===
Q: If you must know , we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends .
A: Otherwise known as an orgy ?
===
Q: Daddy , people expect me to be there !
A: If Kat 's not going , you 're not going .
===
Q: Oh , God . It 's starting .
A: It 's just a party . Daddy .
===
Q: Daddy , I want to discuss the prom with you . It 's tomorrow night --
A: The prom ? Kat has a date ?
Q: He 's not a `` hot rod '' . Whatever that is .
A: You 're not going unless your sister goes . End of story .
===
Q: I was kidding . People actually live there ?
A: Yeah . A couple . We 're outnumbered by the cows , though .
===
Q: Why do girls like that always like guys like that ?
A: Because they 're bred to . Their mothers liked guys like that , and their grandmothers before them . Their gene pool is rarely diluted .
===
Q: Guess who just signed up for a tutor ?
A: You mean I 'd get a chance to talk to her ?
===
Q: Yeah , just a minor encounter with the shrew .
A: That 's her ? Bianca 's sister ?
===
Q: I teach her French , get to know her , dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me .
A: Unlikely , but even so , she still ca n't go out with you . So what 's the point ?
===
Q: What makes you think he 'll do it ?
A: He seems like he thrives on danger
Q: No kidding . He 's a criminal . I heard he lit a state trooper on fire . He just got out of Alcatraz ...
A: They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology ?
Q: I 'm serious , man , he 's whacked . He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers .
A: Forget his reputation . Do you think we 've got a plan or not ?
Q: Did she actually say she 'd go out with you ?
A: That 's what I just said
===
Q: You humiliated the woman ! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score .
A: Best case scenario , you 're back on the payroll for awhile .
===
Q: She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns . That 's a direct quote
A: She just needs time to cool off I 'll give it a day .
===
Q: The vintage look is over , Kat . Have n't you been reading your Sassy ?
A: Yeah , and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow . Tough break .
===
Q: You need money to take a girl out
A: But you 'd go out with her if you had the cake ?
===
Q: You got it , Verona . I pick up the tab , you do the honors .
A: You 're gon na pay me to take out some girl ?
===
Q: Take it or leave it . This is n't a negotiation .
A: Fifty , and you 've got your man .
===
Q: Watching the bitch trash my car does n't count as a date .
A: I got her under control . She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image .
===
Q: But she ca n't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her . right ?
A: Does this conversation have a purpose ?
===
Q: I hear you 're helpin ' Verona .
A: Uh , yeah . We 're old friend .
===
Q: You better not fuck this up . I 'm heavily invested .
A: Hey -- it 's all for the higher good right ?
===
Q: That 's Pat Verona ? The one who was gone for a year ? I heard he was doing porn movies .
A: I 'm sure he 's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting .
===
Q: The people at this school are so incredibly foul .
A: You could always go with me . I 'm sure William has some friends .
===
Q: You went to the party ? I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity .
A: I did n't have a choice .
Q: You did n't have a choice ? Where 's Kat and what have you done with her ?
A: I did Bianca a favor and it backfired .
===
Q: Can you even imagine ? Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess ?
A: Well , I guess we 're not , since we do n't have dates .
Q: Listen to you ! You sound like Betty , all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica .
A: Okay , okay , we wo n't go . It 's not like I have a dress anyway
Q: You 're looking at this from the wrong perspective . We 're making a statement .
A: Oh , good . Something new and different for us .
===
Q: William - he asked me to meet him here .
A: Oh , honey -- tell me we have n't ' progressed to full-on hallucinations .
===
Q: Then say you 'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me .
A: And why would I do that ?
Q: Come on -- the ponies , the flat beer , you with money in your eyes , me with my hand on your ass ...
A: You -- covered in my vomit .
===
Q: You 're not a big talker , are you ?
A: Depends on the topic . My fenders do n't really whip me into a verbal frenzy .
===
Q: You know , these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats , but they 're right up there .
A: You know who The Raincoats are ?
===
Q: I say , do what you wan na do .
A: Funny , you 're the only one
===
Q: Uh , uh . You lie down and you 'll go to sleep
A: I know , just let me sleep
===
Q: I know . It 'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila . You do n't seem like the type .
A: Hey man ... You do n't think I can be `` cool '' ? You do n't think I can be `` laid back '' like everyone else ?
===
Q: And I 'm in control of it .
A: But it 's Gigglepuss - I know you like them . I saw you there .
===
Q: So what 's up with your dad ? He a pain in the ass ?
A: He just wants me to be someone I 'm not .
===
Q: Excuse me , have you seen The Feminine Mystique ? I lost my copy .
A: What are you doing here ?
===
Q: Unwelcome ? I guess someone still has her panties in a twist .
A: Do n't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties .
Q: So what did I have an effect on ?
A: Other than my upchuck reflex ? Nothing .
===
Q: I guess I never told you I 'm afraid of heights .
A: C'mon . It 's not that bad .
===
Q: No -- something real . Something no one else knows .
A: You 're sweet . And sexy . And completely hot for me .
===
Q: Create a little drama ? Start a new rumor ? What ?
A: So I have to have a motive to be with you ?
===
Q: How 'd you get a tux at the last minute ?
A: It 's Scurvy 's . His date got convicted . Where 'd you get the dress ?
===
Q: A Fender Strat . You bought this ?
A: I thought you could use it . When you start your band .
===
Q: Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill ?
A: Because I like to torture you .
Q: Oh , Bianca ? Can you get me my freshman yearbook ?
A: Do n't you even dare ...
===
Q: Is this about Sarah Lawrence ? You punishing me ?
A: I thought you were punishing me .
Q: Why ca n't we agree on this ?
A: Because you 're making decisions for me .
Q: As a parent , that 's my right
A: So what I want does n't matter ?
Q: You 're eighteen . You do n't know what you want . You wo n't know until you 're forty-five and you do n't have it .
A: I want to go to an East Coast school ! I want you to trust me to make my own choices . I want --
===
Q: I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron 's love is pure . Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey 's .
A: Dorsey can plow whoever he wants . I 'm just in this for the cash .
===
Q: That 's where we can help you . With Kat .
A: So Dorsey can get the girl ?
===
Q: I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows .
A: I 'm likin ' you guys better
===
Q: You were right . She 's still pissed .
A: Sweet love , renew thy force !
===
Q: It was a bratwurst . I was eating lunch .
A: With the teeth of your zipper ?
===
Q: You were n't abused , you are n't stupid , and as far as I can tell , you 're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you 're such a fuck-up ?
A: Well , you know -- there 's the prestige of the job title ... and the benefits package is pretty good ...
===
Q: They 'll dance , they 'll kiss , they 'll come home . Let her go .
A: Kissing ? Is that what you think happens ? Kissing is n't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day .
===
Q: What are you listening to , chicken ass ?
A: Ah , leave him alone . He 's doing no harm .
===
Q: You say Asia can be found by sailing west ?
A: Yes , your Eminence . The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks .
===
Q: Your Eminence , there is only one way to settle the matter . And that is to make the journey . I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible .
A: Your life , and that of others !
===
Q: If God intended our proximity to Asia , do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world ?
A: Did He not choose a carpenter 's son to reveal Himself to the world ?
===
Q: He is a mercenary ! Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions ?
A: Indeed . The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them , when it benefits them . My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain .
===
Q: It wo n't be easy to get rid of your prophet now , Don Sanchez .
A: On the contrary , Your Eminence . It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross .
===
Q: I have n't given you much of a life .
A: Well ... that 's true . I have a child by a man who wo n't marry me ! Who 's always leaving ...
===
Q: Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman ...
A: I find that hard to believe .
===
Q: I 'm not asking you to swear to anything .
A: I do n't want you to wait for me .
===
Q: Beatrix , I want to ask you something .
A: You do n't usually ask .
===
Q: God ... you 're so beautiful ! I ca n't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me ...
A: They tried ... but I did n't let them .
===
Q: What is it , now ? Tell me ...
A: I ca n't keep my eyes off you . I would like to catch up with all the moments I did n't spend with you .
===
Q: I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands ? Is it not so ?
A: Forgive me , Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken .
===
Q: How could I be ? The mainland has been found . Exactly as I said it would .
A: I am afraid this is not the worst news .
===
Q: Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven ?
A: Yes ... Yes , I do ... On all of them !
===
Q: I want you to tell me everything you remember , Father . From the beginning . Everything .
A: Really ? God ... I would n't know where to start ... and yet ...
===
Q: And were you never ambitious , Excellency ? Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles , a fault for the rest of us ?
A: If you wo n't accept our proposal , we 'll simply find someone who will .
===
Q: You seem to have a special talent for making friends .
A: What ... ? Do I have so many already ?
===
Q: I am not afraid of you . You are nothing but a dreamer .
A: Look out of that window .
===
Q: You have to find them , Utapan . Look what they did !
A: You did the same to your God !
===
Q: Utapan , wo n't you speak to me ? You used to know how to speak to me .
A: You never learned how to speak my language .
===
Q: Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious ... Brothers should be raised together , Colon . Even brothers from different mothers ...
A: Father , I am doing what I think is the best for him . And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself .
===
Q: God ... That 's in a week !
A: That 's what it says .
===
Q: Why do you wish to sail west ?
A: To open a new route to Asia . At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it ...
===
Q: How can you be so certain ? The Ocean is said to be infinite .
A: Ignorance ! I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands .
===
Q: You get so carried away when you are being contradicted !
A: I 've been contradicted all my life ... Eternity !
===
Q: You must n't give way to despair . You must wait .
A: Wait ! I 've waited seven years already ! How much longer do you want me to wait ?
===
Q: May God forgive you ... ! You must tell them ! You must tell your men !
A: If I tell them , they wo n't follow me . You know that I am right , Father . You trust me ...
===
Q: I suppose we 're both old men now .
A: You 'll always be older than me , Father .
===
Q: I can not ignore the verdict of my council .
A: Surely you can do anything you want .
===
Q: How old are you , Senor Colon ?
A: Thirty seven , Your Majesty ... And you ?
===
Q: There is one thing I 'd like to understand ... Why do you want to go back , after all this ?
A: Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things . I must see them with my own eyes . I can not be other than I am .
===
Q: And you say this is an Indian vice ? By God ! I do n't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin .
A: The Indians have no such word , Don Moxica .
===
Q: We lost cousins , friends . We will wash this in blood .
A: If you want to keep your head on your shoulders , you 'll do as I say .
===
Q: You want a war ? Fine . We are a thousand . They outnumber us by ten ! Who will you kill ? Which tribe ?
A: We do n't need to know .
===
Q: We ca n't raise the wheel without it .
A: My horse does n't work .
===
Q: Don Moxica -- we all have to work .
A: You did not hear me , Don Colon . Not my horse .
===
Q: Due west , Captain Mendez . And may God be with us ...
A: God be with us admiral .
===
Q: Well ... It 's the men , Sir . They wonder how you know our position . We 've lost sight from land days ago ...
A: And what do you think Mendez ?
===
Q: You lied ! You cheated ! We 're way past 750 leagues !
A: Six days ago , yes .
Q: We 're on the verge of a mutiny , Colon !
A: You think I do n't know that ?
Q: You do n't know anything ! Listen Colon , these are my ships , right ? So I 'm telling you we 're turning back !
A: And then what ? Half of the water has gone , the rest is nearly putrid ! You know that !
Q: Jesus Maria ! I should have never listened to you !
A: You never did . You did all the talking for both of us , remember ?
===
Q: You were right , Don Sanchez ... His demands could never be granted .
A: Never , Your Majesty . Although ...
===
Q: Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying . But with no gold ! The new world proves expensive , Your Majesty .
A: We were n't expecting immediate profits , were we ? We must have faith . We must give time for time .
===
Q: Are you my attorney ? I 'm Emil . I 'm insane .
A: I 'm not your lawyer until I see the money .
===
Q: Do n't worry about him . Think about yourself .
A: What about my movie rights ? Book rights ?
Q: Look , I have n't really focused on that kind of thing .
A: What 's your cut ? How much ?
Q: This is not about money , Emil . I need your trust in me .
A: What else do you need ?
Q: I need to know about your background . I need to know about your upbringing . Why you 're here .
A: Give me another one , please .
===
Q: Tell me about yourself . What you did as a young boy ... what your parents were like .
A: My father always degraded me . Killed my self-esteem . And my mother was blind .
Q: Your father blamed you for your mother 's blindness ?
A: Yeah , he hated me from day when I was born . Put it out . Can you put the cigarette out ?
===
Q: That 's what he did to me . He put cigarettes out on me .
A: Your father put cigarettes out on you ?
Q: Out on my back when I was a small boy .
A: Can I see your back ?
===
Q: I 'm abused . Do n't you think ?
A: I do n't think it 's abuse , I think it 's torture .
===
Q: Now I become custody of police department ?
A: If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they 'll help you with your situation .
Q: I will if they do n't send me back .
A: They wo n't until this is over .
===
Q: The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires .
A: So ... the station is empty ?
===
Q: If I was your boyfriend , I might be .
A: If you were my boyfriend , I 'd suggest you find another girlfriend that is n't going to jail ten-thousand miles away .
===
Q: A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process . Eddie recommended one .
A: No matter what happens ... I 'm glad I met you .
===
Q: I told your partner , I ca n't help . I did n't see anything .
A: C'mon , start at the beginning . You know these people ?
===
Q: Whether you tell us or not , we 'll find out . Better if it comes from you .
A: If I tell you , will you arrest me ?
===
Q: Are you here illegally ? Do n't worry about that . We 'll talk to Immigration . They wo n't deport you .
A: No , no , do n't talk to Immigration !
===
Q: Look , we can help you but right now we have to deal with what 's happening here . Tell us the truth ... is that the truth ?
A: You 're a cop - you 'll never believe me .
===
Q: Well , I 'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I 'd like to be included in decisions .
A: Look , after Jordy briefs me , you can do the press conference . How about that ? The case is all yours .
===
Q: Then why did n't you talk to the reporter ?
A: 'Cause we got more important things to do , like finding out who did it .
===
Q: Chief - mind if I take her ?
A: Okay . But not water sports .
===
Q: The public does n't have any idea what we do and now you 're going to define our image ! This is going to be our Rodney King !
A: What was I supposed to do ? The guy tried to mug me . I was gon na send a cop back - I just forgot .
Q: Forgot ? You handcuffed a civilian to a tree ? !
A: Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian .
===
Q: Did the D.A . videotape her deposition ?
A: Yeah . He finished awhile ago .
===
Q: He got my gun ! Motherfucker was filming the whole time !
A: I know . Relax . Take it easy . Do n't worry , we 'll get those fuckers .
===
Q: I have nothin ' to say . If you wan na contact my attorney ...
A: Homicide , Miss Hearn . It 's Detective Eddie Flemming . Open up .
===
Q: Tall , short-haired , scary eyes . Second guy with him was ... shorter , with a wrestler 's build . And he would n't turn his videocamera off me .
A: He had a videocamera ? Where is she ? Quickly !
===
Q: Hey , that 's great you guys got it all wrapped up , but you do n't mind if we go through the routine ? It gives us somethin ' to do .
A: No , we do n't mind . You mind Leon ?
===
Q: You know what that is , right ?
A: No , what is it ?
===
Q: Well , just so you know , I do n't care about that stuff .
A: Nah , why should you ?
===
Q: Did you get a report from the M.E . ?
A: Sure . But I would like to ask you something . You got a problem with me ?
===
Q: I can watch you , Eddie . Maybe I 'll learn something .
A: This is n't homicide school .
===
Q: You goin ' to the escort service ?
A: You got any better ideas ?
Q: Mind if I ride along with you ?
A: This has nothing to do with your fire .
===
Q: I 'll let you know what happens .
A: This is ridiculous . I 'm not gon na be in your way - we can talk the case over .
Q: Tell you what - I 'll flip you a coin . If you win you can come with me . If you do n't win , you do n't come .
A: I 'll call it ... tails .
===
Q: Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison . Hair salon . Ludwig 's .
A: I 'm on my way with Eddie . Ludwig 's . 63rd and Madison . The suspects might be there already .
===
Q: What are you hiding ? Why are you afraid
A: She just saw two of her friends killed ! They probably threatened her .
===
Q: Look - let me talk to her . Any leads I get , they 're all yours . Just let me have a first crack at her .
A: You wan na talk to her alone ?
Q: C'mon . You intimidate her 'cause you 're a celebrity . She sees me differently .
A: You 're her Savior ? Is she the kid you 're gon na save from the burning building ?
===
Q: Look , Eddie , I 'm tellin ' you - I did n't touch her .
A: Well , you shoulda because nobody 's gon na believe you did n't ... including me .
===
Q: I told you , you know , I thought I was doing the right thing , you know , I think she 's innocent .
A: Well , it 's not up to you to decide whether she 's innocent or not . Do n't you understand , that 's why you 're a professional .
===
Q: Why 'd you help me back there with the Chief ? Why 'd you stand up for me like that ?
A: You know , I do n't know . I like you . You remind me of a puppy I used to have . He pissed on the rug all the time , but I still kept him .
===
Q: Detective , does it look like a murder ?
A: We do n't know that yet . It 's much too early . There 's a lot to be done .
Q: Can we go up to the crime scene ?
A: You know you ca n't do that . C'mon .
===
Q: Detective - can you tell us what happened here ?
A: I ca n't talk right now . We have some things to take care of .
===
Q: I understand , but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you . Is this somehow related to the fire department ?
A: I really ca n't give out any information right now at this point .
Q: Okay . But I do understand that your partner , Leon Jackson 's been injured . Is that correct ?
A: He was hurt , but not seriously . He 'll be fine .
Q: Do you have the suspect in custody ?
A: Um ... now is not a good time , okay . Detective Jackson 's hurt . He 's fine . I 've got a Fire Marshall shot , Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously .
===
Q: What is your problem ? Why 'd you snap at me ? I just wanted a statement .
A: I ca n't ... I ca n't answer you just because you want me to answer you !
Q: You did n't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues . You could give me something .
A: Oh , I 'm sorry . Did I embarrass you , sweetheart ? Oh ...
Q: Yes you are . I 'm not just some reporter . I do n't just stick a microphone in your face . You could give me something .
A: Yeah , well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence . That was ...
===
Q: Okay . That is great . But I ca n't go now , we 're in the middle of something here .
A: No . Go ahead . You 're gon na be great .
Q: No . No , listen to me here . I want to know what you 're talking about . You know , the shoe thing and the marriages and ...
A: I 'll tell you tonight . Let 's do it tonight . As soon as you get back we 'll talk . We 'll talk .
Q: Yeah . I 'll do that . As long as you 're not patronizing me .
A: Patronizing you ... Nay , I love you .
===
Q: I hope this prick does n't run . My knees are killing me . Stay behind me .
A: You 're worried for my safety . I 'm touched .
===
Q: Any chance we can do that again ?
A: Again ? I did n't wan na do it the first time .
===
Q: You 're a butcher ? What do you use pig intestines for ?
A: You stuff sausage in it .
===
Q: No . I 'm the best that 's ever threatened you .
A: I 'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me .
Q: We 'll talk about that . Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank . Three hundred thousand dollars .
A: What ? It does n't work that way .
Q: If you do n't want my film - I 'll call another show . And they will show it .
A: Wait a minute . Wait a minute .
===
Q: Were you a fireman ? That how you knew how to rig the apartment ?
A: My father was . He gave me many lessons about fire . Now it 's my friend .
===
Q: You ca n't kill me . You 're not a cop . Just fireman with a gun . I bet you never shot anybody in your life .
A: You 'll be my first .
===
Q: C'mon . Pull the trigger . Do it . Oh , look , you 're sweating . You do n't have the balls .
A: Get down on your knees .

Q: Tell him to put his gun down !

A: I like to talk to the person who runs the service . Can you give me address ?
===
Q: In here , says he wants a million .
A: Million ? ! The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview ?
===
Q: Turn that off ! Get the bags .
A: Why should I carry your bag ? I am not a dog .
===
Q: Oh , shit . I hate looking at that !
A: Do n't want to film this ?
===
Q: You are success story ? I am success story ! Why do you say I and not we ?

===
Q: In movie they make of us , who do you think would act me ?
A: The one who got caught in the bathroom . George Michael .

Q: This is my project . I say 'action . ' I am the director ! You are the talent . You wait for me to say 'action . ' And 'action ! '
A: Bad last moment - I cut it out .

Q: Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director ?
A: Because I am the director . Do n't you realize , if it was n't for my film , for my talent , my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now .
===
Q: We started over , you can too .
A: You spent all the money while I was in prison ? Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets ? ! ?
===
Q: And you , you 'll pay for what you did !
A: This footage will work in your favor . When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries , they 'll convict him .
===
Q: You outta be ashamed . Ashamed of yourself .
A: If I did n't put it on somebody else would ! I was his friend !
===
Q: So the way you see it , two crack heads burned themselves up ?
A: That 's what it looks like to me .
Q: And while they 're burning up , they 're still goin ' down on each other ? You got to hand it to them .
A: Yeah , well , some people got their priorities straight .
===
Q: Got any spare change ? How 'bout a spare twenty ?
A: Look , I do n't have time for you , get out of my way !
===
Q: Okay , you 're under arrest ! Now you happy ?
A: Fire Department ? Firemen do n't carry guns .
===
Q: I 'll send a cop back for you .
A: Hey . C'mon , you ca n't leave me like this . Some freak 'll come by and stab me !
===
Q: What 's that on your forehead , Max ? That 's a nice attention getter .
A: Yeah , I 'm religious . I 'm not an Atheist like you ! Now , are you guys gon na arrest me , or not ?
===
Q: Where you been , man ? We got a celebrity !
A: I heard . Who the hell let them up there ?
Q: I do n't know , you think Eddie will give me his autograph ?
A: You see anything in the crowd ? Anybody suspicious ?
===
Q: Bobby , Bobby ! Where 're you hit ? !
A: It hurts . Aw , Jesus !
===
Q: Room was registered to a Francis Capra .
A: Capra ? That 's not Czech or Russian . Who said he sounded Russian ?
===
Q: Take the car . Get outta here , Tommy .
A: Look , you ca n't shoot him in cold blood .
===
Q: Look , I 'm in here . You call this a career move ?
A: And is n't there a movie in the works about you ?
Q: We 're in negotiations , that 's correct .
A: But does n't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes ?
===
Q: Hi . Frank ... coming in , please .
A: Right . Just a sec .
===
Q: Dave , if you 've a minute , I 'd like your advice on something .
A: Sure , what is it ?
===
Q: Well , what do you think we ought to do about it ?
A: I do n't think we should make any fuss about it yet . I 'm sure they 'll straighten it out .
Q: I must say , I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training .
A: No . I never did , either .
===
Q: I suppose the idea was specialized training .
A: I suppose so . Though , of course , there 's a more sinister explanation .
===
Q: Not really . Though , it is strange when you think about it . It did n't really make any sense to keep us apart during training .
A: Yes , but it 's to fantastic to think that they 'd keep something from us .
Q: I suppose it is n't logically impossible .
A: I guess it is n't .
===
Q: I suppose computers have been known to be wrong .
A: Yes , but it 's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low .
===
Q: I do n't know . Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure .
A: Two units in four days . How many spares do we have ?
===
Q: I did n't do that Frank . I took particular care not to freeze them .
A: I guess you do n't know your own strength , old boy .
===
Q: I 'm sorry , Frank , but I do n't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know .
A: He 's got a point .
===
Q: Sorry to interrupt the festivities , Dave , but I think we 've got a problem .
A: What is it , Hal ?
===
Q: The unit is still operational , Dave . but it will fail within seventy-two hours .
A: I understand Hal . We 'll take care of it . Please , let me have the hard copy .
===
Q: Not now , Hal , I 'd like to talk to you about something .
A: Sure , Dave , what 's up ?
Q: You probably also know that we found them okay .
A: Yes , I know that . But I can assure you that they were about to fail .
===
Q: I 'm not questioning your word , Dave , but it 's just not possible . I 'm not capable of being wrong .
A: Hal , is there anything bothering you ? Anything that might account for this problem ?
===
Q: Well , do n't worry about it .
A: And do n't you worry about it .
Q: Is your confidence in me fully restored ?
A: Yes , it is , Hal .
===
Q: I suppose it 's because you 've been under a lot of stress , but have you forgotten that they 're not supposed to be revived for another three months .
A: The antenna has to be replaced .
Q: Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation .
A: It does n't have to be , Hal . It 's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth . Let me have manual control , please .
===
Q: If you 're determined to revive the crew now , I can handle the whole thing myself . There 's no need for you to trouble .
A: I 'm goin to do this myself , Hal . Let me have the control , please .
Q: Look , Dave your 've probably got a lot to do . I suggest you leave it to me .
A: Hal , switch to manual hibernation control .
===
Q: I can tell from the tone of your voice , Dave , that you 're upset . Why do n't you take a stress pill and get some rest .
A: Hal , I 'm in command of this ship . I order you to release the manual hibernation control .
===
Q: I 'm at Space Station Five , darling . How are you ?
A: I 'm fine , Daddy . When are you coming home ?
===
Q: One , two , three . Can I speak to Mommy ?
A: Mommy 's out to the hair-dresser .
Q: Okay , sweetheart . Well , I have to go now . Tell Mommy that I called .
A: How many days until you come home ?
===
Q: Well , I 've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic .
A: I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later .
Q: Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight .
A: Yes , well , whatever it is , they 're certainly not fooling around . This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week .
Q: I was working out what this trip must cost , taking him up there by himself and coming back empty .
A: I 'll bet it 's a fortune .
===
Q: He 's fine . But I 'm afraid we do n't get a chance to see each other very much these days .
A: Well , where are all of you off to ?
===
Q: Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal .
A: Well , that does sound very odd .
===
Q: Are you sure you wo n't change your mind about a drink ?
A: No , thank you ... and I 'm afraid now I really must be going .
===
Q: Well , Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you .
A: Thank you . It 's been a great pleasure to meet all of you ... Dr. Smyslov .
===
Q: Well , thank you very much for being so understanding .
A: Please , it really does n't matter .
===
Q: Yes , I think so . Just about then .
A: I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking .
===
Q: Well , as it happens , I 'm on my way up to the moon
A: Are you , by any chance , going up to your base at Clavius ?
===
Q: I 'm sorry , but I 'm not sure I know what you mean .
A: Well , it 's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius .
===
Q: Yes , well at first we thought that was the explanation , but it 's been going on for the past ten days .
A: You mean you have n't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days ?
===
Q: This epidemic could easily spread to our base , Dr. Floyd . We should be given all the facts .
A: Dr. Smyslov ... I 'm not permitted to discuss this .
===
Q: By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill .
A: Any clue as to what it is ?
===
Q: Has it been exposed to any sun before now ?
A: I do n't think it has , but I 'd like to check that . Simpson , what 's the log on that ?
===
Q: Oh , marvellous . It 's the first real sleep I 've had for the past two days .
A: There 's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest .
===
Q: Well , fine . Thanks very much , anyway , and I hope you do n't mind me asking ?
A: No , of course , Captain , I can understand your concern .
===
Q: Right . Hal , tell me whether the following statements are true or false .
A: I will if I can , Frank .
===
Q: I know you did , Frank , but I assure you there was an impending failure .
A: Let me see the tracking alignment display .
===
Q: Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault ?
A: Not really , Frank . I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure .
===
Q: We do n't wash 'em , ya know .
A: How about chargin ' the battery ?
===
Q: Maybe you better have a Black Russian .
A: No , man , I think I 'll have a vodka .
===
Q: I do n't give a damn about his girl ...
A: Look , give me a break , you 're going to have to settle for her place . It 's the only thing I know .
===
Q: I never paid for it in my life .
A: It 's better when you pay ... they let you do anything .
Q: They always let me do anything . I do n't want to pay for it . I never paid for it in my life .
A: Just do what I say , okay ? We 'll pay for the girls and have a good time ... Do n't you trust me ?
===
Q: Maybe that 's where I 'm gon na cut your throat .
A: He 's just kiddin ' , you just keep doin ' what I tell ya , you 'll be okay .
===
Q: Hey , what kind of talk is that ?
A: Oh ... You 're a schoolteacher ...
===
Q: You just quit bein ' a priest or somethin ' ?
A: No , baby , nothin ' like that . Look , there 's a place across the street . We can go right over there ...
===
Q: Well , maybe I 'll see you later ...
A: Here 's hoping , baby ...
===
Q: I 'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco ... how 'd that be ? Then we 'll go dancin ' , okay ?
A: Now you 're talkin ' . See ya ...
===
Q: You and the other one , you 're still Billy 's girls . You always were his girls ...
A: Yeah . Sure , i 'm crazy in love with him , who would n't be ...
===
Q: After I get outta this , cop ... I 'm gon na live forever ...
A: I do n't think you 're gon na make it .
===
Q: I got hit . I ca n't believe it . I got shot .
A: You 're done . End of story .
===
Q: You here to write my life story ?
A: Not likely , Reggie . Maybe I just need some help .
===
Q: What 's the big deal about you bein ' on the street ?
A: I got a lot to protect .
===
Q: This prison gives out $ 400 suits ?
A: What are you talkin ' about ? This suit 's mine . It cost $ 900 .
===
Q: Okay , let 's get down to it . I did my part and got you out . So now you tell me where we 're goin ' ?
A: Do n't worry , I got a move for ya . An awesome move . A guy named Luther . Ganz 'll be paying him a visit . We go to him right away .
Q: I can read a police file , shithead , and quit calling me Jack .
A: Just an expression man , do n't mean nothin ' .
===
Q: Just up the street , the other side , over there ... Now , do n't bother knockin ' on the door . Luther ai n't the kind of guy that looks for company .
A: Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me ?
Q: Luther ai n't the reliable type . I do n't want you shot yet , Cates ... not before you been a help to me .
A: I 'm helpin ' you , huh ?
===
Q: Quit playin ' cop and undo this cuff , Jack , I need to talk to this man .
A: I 'm tellin ' you to drop the Goddam gun .
===
Q: We 're on the move . Let 's go . As they walk toward a corridor .
A: Do you know how close I was to getting some trim . And you fucked ' it up .
Q: Yeah , well , my ass bleeds for you . And I did n't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn `` trim '' hunt ... stop moaning .
A: Speakin ' of moans my Stomach is startin ' to growl .
===
Q: Who 'd you call on the phone back at the booking station ?
A: Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut .
===
Q: Now , where we goin ' , convict ?
A: Mission District . Gon na find us an Indian .
===
Q: I do n't give out the details .
A: Last night , two nights ago , three ?
===
Q: Sure . Then we had a fight this morning .
A: At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you ... Tell me a little about her . She got great tits ?
===
Q: This part of town , they 'll make us for heat the second we walk in . Just back me up like you 've got a piece ...
A: Back you up ? Now why would I wan na do that ?
Q: If they kick my ass , they 'll sure as hell carve yours up ...
A: But you can handle it all right , huh ? Real amazin ' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats ...
===
Q: I 'll tell you what happens if you lose ... you tell the truth for once .
A: What are you talkin ' about ?
Q: You tell me what Ganz busted out for , he 's after a lot more than just gettin ' out of jail . And whatever it is , you 're part of it .
A: I do n't know what you 're talking about . I just wan na see Ganz nailed .
===
Q: I 'm gon na enjoy this ... here , I 'll even loan you my badge .
A: I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes .
===
Q: This place do n't seem real popular with the brothers .
A: My kind of place . I always liked country boys .
===
Q: That was n't necessary , buddy . I got this under control .
A: Some of us citizens are with you all the way , Officer .
===
Q: Yeah , right . You want to try again ?
A: Naw , you 'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time .
===
Q: You gon na let me keep any of it ?
A: Depends on how things work out . I believe in the merit system . So far you have n't built up any points .
===
Q: You took a big chance , leaving this here all this time .
A: Not really . I figured Ganz was put down for a long time . And I knew Luther would never job me on his own . He 's too chickenshit .
===
Q: Jesus Christ , look at all the dust on my car ... why in the hell do n't he take it to a car wash ?
A: Did n't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs .
===
Q: You 'd think the guy 'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed .
A: Tryin ' to save his girl , man . He 's in another world .
Q: If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass , I 'd just leave town .
A: I 'm tellin ' you the man 's in love ... he wants to be a hero for his girl .
===
Q: Say , do you always work people over like you did Luther ?
A: If they do n't tell me what I need to know ...
===
Q: Maybe Luther hopes Ganz 'll give him a piece of your money ...
A: If he 's hoping that then he 's dumber than I think he is , which would be amazin ' , cause I already think he 's real dumb .
===
Q: We 're getting too close ... Cates , what 's the matter , you been takin ' dumb pills ?
A: Yeah , most cops are pretty dumb ... But since you 're the one that landed in jail what 's that make you ?
===
Q: That was in style a couple years back , man .
A: Right . if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping , then you 're all set .
===
Q: Maybe we should pay Luther a visit .
A: Let him get some sleep . He 's going to need it .
===
Q: Tell me something . Why did n't you just take the money off Luther and split ?
A: Forget it . I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you ...
===
Q: Hey , how 'd my car get here ?
A: I had it impounded . Come on , we 'll use it for haulin ' you back to the slam .
Q: Back to jail in my own car . Ganz got away . Got all my money . It just do n't seem right .
A: I do n't know about you , but I could use a drink ... I 'll buy you one . It 'll be my good-bye present .
===
Q: Sorry we did n't do better , Jack . I feel like I let you down .
A: Naw , you did n't let me down . It was a long shot all the way . We gave 'em a good run at it .
===
Q: It 's late , they 're closing ...
A: Do n't worry about it .
===
Q: Do I get to kiss her too ?
A: If she 's right , and if you do n't screw up .
===
Q: What if your girl 's theory turns out to be bullshit ? I mean , they could be in Rio de Janeiro .
A: I 've got to play it rough with them . If they know anything , I 'm gon na know it .
===
Q: If we run into Billy first , let me try and talk him in .
A: Sure , I 'll give you a shot at it , but Ganz is mine . You know , that big Indian plays it for keeps ...
===
Q: Okay , reggie , start bustin ' my chops ... Tell me how great you were with that chick .
A: Hey , Jack , real men do n't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic .
===
Q: It 's your money . It 'll be here in six months when you get out .
A: And you 're tellin ' me you do n't want any of this cash ?
Q: That 's right . Not my style , Reggie .
A: You are an awesomely weird cop . Sure wish there were more like you runnin ' around out here .
Q: No , you do n't . If I ever get word of you steppin ' over the line again , I 'm gon na ventilate that suit of yours .
A: Spare met Jack . I 'm into legit investments from here on in .
===
Q: Yeah . It bothers me when cops get hurt while I 'm makin ' a play . I do n't like it .
A: You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one , Jack .
===
Q: Do n't duck the bullet Cates . Why did n't you call in for backup instead of makin ' a grandstand play ?
A: I did n't have the time .
===
Q: Where the Christ do you think you 're going ?
A: I 'm taking my prisoner back to jail .
===
Q: But that 's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we 're always the ones fucking up when you tell it ...
A: The truth hurts , does n't it , buddy ?
===
Q: Somebody steals your gun , you 're supposed to file a report .
A: Are you gon na tell me about police procedure ? Do me a favor , do n't give me a bunch of crap .
===
Q: Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel ?
A: Every last bit of it . The big guy 's room was empty .
===
Q: Wait a minute , wait a minute ... who 's this ?
A: Uhh ... Wong , Henry Wong . He was in on the same job .
===
Q: I think I wan na have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking . Can we find them ?
A: Here 's the file . Cates checks the file .
===
Q: I got to wait for a call .
A: Okay . See you in the morning ... you know , you ought to get some rest ...
===
Q: Jesus Christ . Why the hell did n't you tell me before ?
A: I 'm not paid to take your personal calls . He was in some bar ... off duty .
===
Q: Ganz and Billy got my girl , Rosalie .
A: I think I met her . Now tell us something we do n't know , like where they stashed her .
===
Q: I do n't think your gun 's loaded ...
A: This is a.44 Magnum , the most powerful handgun in the world . You got ta ask yourself just one question . Are you feelin ' lucky ?
===
Q: Are n't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit ?
A: I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit . But just because I think it 's bullshit does n't mean I do n't know something about it .
===
Q: You know , if you let me come over to your place once in a while , you could put on a clean shirt in the morning .
A: What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place ?
===
Q: Maybe you ought to buy me one .
A: Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back .
===
Q: That 's a fairly crummy way to start a morning .
A: Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead .
===
Q: You know something , Jack , you really are hopeless .
A: That 's the way I see it , too .
===
Q: Yeah , Guess it must have been a slow news day ...
A: Jack , are you okay ?
===
Q: Listen , Goddamn it if you think I 'm happy about it , you 're nuts . I just got ta take care of a few things , okay ?
A: This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave .
===
Q: I 'm at work , asshole . Where else ?
A: Elaine ! I ... I 'm sorry ... I was expecting somebody else ... police business .
===
Q: The number ... what 's the Goddamn number ?
A: Jack ? What was that ?
===
Q: I ought to have you and your friend thrown out ...
A: Do n't . We 've had a hard night .
Q: I can see that . Pardon me for saying so , but you look like shit . What happened ?
A: We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours ...
===
Q: Nothing . No sign of Ganz . No sign of the Indian . Airport 's clean . Train station . Bus station . Docks ... Shit ...
A: Ganz is going to be hard to track . Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed ... totally without any pattern ... kill anybody ... The Indian ... himself ... anybody ...
===
Q: How 'd they take it back at headquarters ?
A: Usual bullshit . You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend ... You know somethin ' , shootin ' guys sucks . Especially compared to this .
===
Q: I 'm not so sure I can say the same thing ... You do n't look like a cop .
A: Well , I been workin ' the other side of the street for the last few years . And you do n't exactly look like a shrink , wearin ' that dress ...
===
Q: I want the money , asshole , what do you think ? The money that Reggie hid ...
A: I do n't know what you 're talkin ' about .
===
Q: Instead of worryin ' about Reggie , you better worry about me ...
A: Do n't give me this , we were partners .
Q: Billy , go ahead , break it ...
A: No ! Do n't kill her . I can get you the money .
===
Q: Come on , you can trust me . Please .
A: You try to mess with us or go to the cops , I promise you , I 'll put holes in her you would n't believe .
===
Q: Fuck you . You got no right for this kind of play .
A: I 'll got your money to you . No sweat .
===
Q: Personally , they are of no interest to me , I 'd rather sell weapons , but I have a customer ... so tell me ...
A: Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you .
===
Q: Father , by creating a little destruction , I am , in fact , encouraging life ! So , in reality , you and I are in the same business !
A: Destroying a glass is one thing , killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another .
===
Q: Excuse me , I 'm looking for a priest .
A: Weddings are one floor down . Congratulations .
===
Q: She 's not my bride , she 's my fare . She 's looking for this Vito Cornelius . According to the phone guide he lives here .
A: That 's me . But I do n't know who she is ... where did you find her ?
===
Q: There 's not a moment to lose ! Wake her up , but be gentle about it ! This woman is mankind 's most precious possession ! She is ... perfect !
A: So you do know her .
===
Q: Yes . That 's fine ! Thank you very much . A thousand times over !
A: I might call to check up on her , you know ... to see if she 's better ?
Q: She 's fine , really , do n't you worry , just needs some rest . She 's had a very long trip .
A: I know . I was there when she arrived .
===
Q: I 'm sorry to have to resort to such methods , but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston .
A: Is that the usual way priests go on vacation ?
===
Q: You 're probably very angry with me and I quite understand . But I want you to know I 'm fighting for a noble cause .
A: Yeah , I know ... to save the world ... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo .
===
Q: There 's no light ! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light .
A: Yes , of course , but ... The Stones are shut ! They have to be open for it to work .
Q: And you do n't know how they open , is that what you are saying ?
A: That 's what I 'm saying .
===
Q: Your theory is interesting Father but I do n't think we have time to go into it right now !
A: Time is of no importance , Mr. President . Only life is important .
===
Q: But what happens if instead of this ... Ultimate Warrior ... it is EVIL who stands here ?
A: White turns to black . Light to Dark . Life to Death . For all eternity .
===
Q: Father , will you please explain what 's going on ?
A: The Supreme Being , the fifth element is here , in our parish ! It 's a miracle !
===
Q: Father . You sure she 's the Supreme Being ?
A: Absolutely sure There 's the triple suns on her gloves !
===
Q: I got it ! Everything here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel ... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel !
A: Good work , my son . Now all we need is a way to get there .
===
Q: You 're all safe . Thanks be to God !
A: Later , David ! Later ! There 's not a minute to lose !
===
Q: She was taught to love the life of others ... but not her own . You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live !
A: I 'll help her , I promise , but I think you should tell me where the Stones are !
Q: I do n't have time ... I need to know .
A: Listen , the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again .
===
Q: I 'm sorry , but ... the Stones ...
A: They are ... with me ...
===
Q: I love you too Major , but you have n't called me that since basic training .
A: I was talking to the cat .
===
Q: Finger ! I 'm driving a cab now , not a space fighter !
A: How many points you got left on your license ?
===
Q: I 'm sorry . Listen , I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap , y'know one of those big fares you just ca n't resist .
A: So , just how big was this fare ?
===
Q: Will the elements be gone now forever from this place ?
A: When mankind comes to its senses . We will return .
Q: Knowing mankind as I do , that could take centuries !
A: Time is of no importance , only life is important .
===
Q: I 'm coming ! . Ma , what 're you talking about ?
A: I get it ! You want to make me beg , is that it ?
===
Q: You just won a trip , you dolt ! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two !
A: Ma . If I 'd won , I 'd know about it . Someone would have notified me .
===
Q: My main man ! Please do n't leave me here alone . My head 's killing me and my adoring fans are gon na tear me apart ! Get me outta here !
A: I 'll take you to the bar , after that , you 're on your own .
Q: Oh , yes ! Do that ! You treat me right , man . Tell me all about yourself , your roots , your personal life , your childhood dreams ...
A: I do n't think this is a good time ...
===
Q: You know how to fly this thing ?
A: It 's like a cab is n't it ?
===
Q: Solid little jobs , are n't they ?
A: Dear listeners , your favorite DJ is alive and kicking . It 's seven o'clock and time for the news . Tune in tomorrow for another adventure .
===
Q: What did you say ? What did you do ?
A: Nothing ! Swear to God , I did n't do nothing !
===
Q: You could n't come up with something a little more discreet ?

===
Q: It 's a film ... of a girl being murdered .
A: I 'm afraid I do n't ...
===
Q: If you were to study it you 'd see the camera cutting away ... you 'd see the tricks they can play ...
A: I 'm telling you it 's not that .

A: It 's lonely in there , in my room .
===
Q: I 'm sorry your boyfriend got killed .
A: How did you know that ?

===
Q: No you 're not . You do n't even care about being a mom . How come you do n't think about me ?

Q: Okay , babe . What 's the matter ?
A: Nothing ... it 's just ... I did n't see my father at the ceremony .

Q: I was afraid you were n't coming .
A: I watched from behind the stands . Did n't want to embarrass you , ya know . `` The drunk showed up '' , that kind of thing ...
Q: That 's in the past . Unless you 've stopped going to the meetings .

A: No , the Dan part was nice ...
===
Q: Good to see you again , Mr. Grey . I 've got to go find Dan .
A: Yeah , before they revoke his diploma .
===
Q: It was no accident . It was Krueger . He used to get in through my dreams , but not anymore . He 's found some other way .
A: Alice , it 's no dream . I 'm sorry ... Dan 's dead .
===
Q: Have you visited the little boy on my floor ? Jacob , the one who looks kind of sad ?
A: There are n't any little boys on your floor .
===
Q: What 's that got to do with it ?

===
Q: It was just an accident . Like with Dan .
A: No accident . I tried to warn all of you about Krueger .
===
Q: I do n't understand what 's happening . Krueger has to use my dreams , but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake . How 's he doing it ?
A: Why do n't you two stick to reality .
===
Q: You had me scared on the phone . What 's wrong with the baby ?
A: I think Krueger 's trying to do something to it .
